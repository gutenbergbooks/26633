INTRODUCTION
<br>


<p>Few words will be necessary by way of preface to this book,
which is designed as an introduction to a little understood and much
misrepresented subject.</p>

<p>I have not here written anything which is intended to displace
the observations of other authors on this subject, nor will it be found that
anything has been said subversive of the conclusions arrived at by
experimentalists who have essayed the study of clairvoyant phenomena in a manner
that is altogether commendable, and who have sought to place the subject on a
demonstrable and scientific basis. I refer to the proceedings of the Society for
Psychical Research.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have endeavoured to indicate the nature
of the faculty of Second Sight or Clairvoyance, the means of its development,
the use of suitable media or agents for this purpose, and the kind of results
that may be expected to follow a regulated effort in this direction. I have also
sought to show that the development of the psychic faculties may form an orderly
step in the process of human unfoldment and perfectibility.</p>

<p>As far as the nature and scope of this little work will allow, I
have sought to treat the subject on a broad and general basis rather than pursue
more particular and possibly more attractive scientific lines. What I have here
said is the result of a personal experience of some years in this and other
forms of psychic development and experimentation. My conclusions are given for
what they are worth, and I have no wish to persuade my readers to my view of the
nature and source of these abnormal phenomena. The reader is at liberty to form
his own theory in regard to them, but such theory should be inclusive of all the
known facts. The theories depending on hypnotic suggestion may be dismissed as
inadequate. There appear to remain only the inspirational theory of direct
revelation and the theory of the world-soul enunciated by the Occultists. I have
elected in favour of the latter for reasons which, I think, will be conspicuous
to those who read these pages.</p>

<p>I should be the last to allow the study of psychism to usurp the
legitimate place in life of intellectual and spiritual pursuits, and I look with
abhorrence upon the flippant use made of the psychic faculties by a certain
class of pseudo-occultists who serve up this kind of thing with their five
o'clock tea. But I regard an ordered psychism as a most valuable accessory to
intellectual and spiritual development and as filling a natural place in the
process of unfoldment between that intellectualism that is grounded in the
senses and that higher intelligence which receives its light from within. From
this view-point the following pages are written, and will, I trust, prove
helpful.</p>

<br>
CHAPTER I.
<br>
<br>
THE SCIENTIFIC POSITION
<br>


<p>It would perhaps be premature to make any definite pronouncement
as to the scientific position in regard to the psychic phenomenon known as
"scrying," and certainly presumptuous on my part to cite an authority from among
the many who have examined this subject, since all are not agreed upon the
nature and source of the observed phenomena. Their names are, moreover, already
identified with modern scientific research and theory, so that to associate them
with experimental psychology would be to lend colour to the idea that modern
science has recognized this branch of knowledge. Nothing, perhaps, is further
from the fact, and while it cannot in any way be regarded as derogatory to the
highest scientist to be associated with others, of less scientific attainment
but of equal integrity, in this comparatively new field of enquiry, it may lead
to popular error to institute a connection. It is still fresh in the mind how
the Darwinian hypothesis was utterly misconceived by the popular mind, the
suggestion that man was descended from the apes being generally quoted as a
correct expression of Darwin's theory, whereas he never suggested any such
thing, but that man and the apes had a common ancestor, which makes of the ape
rather a degenerate lemur than a human ancestor. Other and more prevalent errors
will occur to the reader, these being due to the use of what is called "the
evidence of the senses"; and of all criteria the evidence of sensation is
perhaps the most faulty. Logical inference from deductive or inductive reasoning
has often enough been a good monitor to sense-perception, and has, moreover,
pioneered the man of science to correct knowledge on more than one occasion. But
as far as we know or can learn from the history of human knowledge, our senses
have been the chiefest source of error. It is with considerable caution that the
scientist employs the evidence from sense alone, and in the study of
experimental psychology it is the sense which has first to be corrected, and
which, in fact, forms the great factor in the equation. A person informs me that
he can see a vision in the crystal ball before him, and although I am in the
same relation with the "field" as he, I cannot see anything except accountable
reflections. This fact does not give any room for contradicting him or any right
to infer that it is all imagination. It is futile to say the vision does not
exist. If he sees it, it does exist so far as he is concerned. There is no more
a universal community of sensation than of thought. When I am at work my own
thought is more real than any impression received through the sense organs. It
is louder than the babel of voices or the strains of instrumental music, and
more conspicuous than any object upon which the eye may fall. These external
impressions are admitted or shut out at will. I then know that my thought is as
real as my senses, that the images of thought are as perceptible as those
exterior to it and in every way as objective and real. The thought-form has this
advantage, however, that it can be given a durable or a temporary existence, and
can be taken about with me without being liable to impost as "excess luggage."
In the matter of evidence in psychological questions, therefore, sense
perceptions are only second-rate criteria and ought to be received with caution.</p>

<p>Almost all persons dream, and while dreaming they see and hear,
touch and taste, without questioning for a moment the reality of these
experiences. The dreaming person loses sight of the fact that he is in a bedroom
of a particular house, that he has certain relations with others sleeping in the
same house. He loses sight of the fact that his name is, let us say, Henry, and
that he is famous for the manufacture of a particular brand of soap or cheese.
For him, and as long as it lasts, the dream is the one reality. Now the question
of the philosopher has always been: which is the true dream, the sleeping dream
or the waking dream? The fact that the one is continuous of itself while the
other is not, and that we always fall into a new dream but always wake to the
same reality, has given a permanent value to the waking or external life, and an
equally fictitious one to the interior or dreaming life. But what if the dream
life became more or less permanent to the exclusion of all other memories and
sensations? We should then get a case of insanity in which hallucination would
be symptomic. (The dream state is more or less permanent with certain poetical
temperaments, and if there is any insanity attaching to it at all, it consists
in the inability to react.) Imagination, deep thought and grief are as much
anaesthetic as chloroform. But the closing of the external channels of sensation
is usually the signal for the opening of the psychic, and from all the evidence
it would seem that the psychic sense is more extensive, acuter and in every way
more dependable than the physical. I never yet have met the man or woman whose
impaired eyesight required that he or she should use glasses in order to see
while asleep. That they do see is common experience, and that they see farther,
and therefore better, with the psychic sense than with the physical has been
often proved. Emanuel Swedenborg saw a fire in Stockholm when he was resident in
England and gave evidence of it before the vision was confirmed by news from
Sweden. A lady of my acquaintance saw and described a fire taking place at a
country seat about 150 miles away, the incident being true to the minutest
details, many of which were exceptional and in a single instance tragic. The
psychic sense is younger than the physical, as the soul is younger than the
body, and its faculty continues unimpaired long after old age and disease have
made havoc of the earthly vestment. The soul is younger at a thousand years than
the body is at sixty. Let it be admitted upon evidence that there are two sorts
of sense perception, the physical and the psychical, and that in some persons
the latter is as much in evidence as the former. We have to enquire then
what relations the crystal or other medium has to the development and exercise
of the clairvoyant faculty. We know comparatively little about atomic structure
in relation to nervous organism. The atomicity of certain chemical bodies does
not inform us as to why one should be a deadly poison and another perfectly
innocuous. We regard different bodies as congeries of atoms, but it is a
singular fact that of two bodies containing exactly the same elements in the
same proportions the one is poisonous and the other harmless. The only
difference between them is the atomic arrangement.</p>

<p>The atomic theory refers all bodies to one homogeneous basic
substance, which has been termed protyle (proto-hyle), from which, by means of a
process loosely defined as differentiation, all the elements are derived. These
elements are the result of atomic arrangement. The atoms have various
vibrations, the extent of which is called the mean free path of vibration;
greatest in hydrogen and least in the densest element. All matter is
indestructible, but at the same time convertible, and these facts, together with
the absolute association of matter and force, lead to the conclusion that every
change of matter implies a change of force. Matter, therefore, is ever living
and active, and there is no such thing as dead matter anywhere. The hylo-idealists
have therefore regarded all matter as but the ultimate expression of spirit, and
primarily of a spiritual origin.</p>

<p>The somewhat irksome phraseology of Baron Swedenborg has dulled
many minds to a sense of his great acumen and philosophical depth, but it maybe
convenient to summarize his scientific doctrine of "Correspondences" in this
place as it has an important bearing on the subject in hand. He laid down the
principle of the spiritual origin of force and matter. Matter, he argued, was
the ultimate expression of spirit, as form was that of force. Spirit is to force
what matter is to form--its substratum. Hence for every spiritual force there is
a corresponding material form, and thus the material or natural world
corresponds at all points to the world of spirit, without being identical. The
apparent hiatus between one plane of existence and the next he called a discrete
degree, while the community between different bodies on the same plane he called
a continuous degree. Thus there is community of sensation between bodies of the
same nature, community of feeling, community of thought, and community of desire
or aspiration, each on its own plane of existence. But desire is translated into
thought, thought into feeling, and feeling into action. The spirit, soul
(rational and animal in its higher and lower aspects), and the body appear to
have been the principles of the human constitution according to this authority.
All spirits enjoy community, as all souls and all bodies on their respective
planes of existence; but between spirit and soul, as between soul and body,
there is a discrete degree. In fine, mind is continuous of mind all through the
universe, as matter is continuous of matter; while mind and matter are separated
and need to be translated into terms of one another.</p>

<p>Taking our position from the scientific statement of the atomic
structure of bodies, atomic vibration and molecular arrangement, we may now
consider the action exerted by such bodies upon the nervous organism of man.</p>

<p>The function of the brain, which may be regarded as the bulbous
root of a plant whose branches grow downwards, is twofold: to affect, and to be
affected. In its active and positive condition it affects the whole of the vital
and muscular processes in the body, finding expression in vital action. In its
passive and negative state it is affected by impressions coming to it in
different ways through the sense organs, resulting in nervous and mental action.
These two functions are interdependent. It is the latter or afferent function
with which we are now concerned. The range of our sense-perceptions puts us
momentarily in relations with the material world, or rather, with a certain
portion of it. For we by no means sense all that is sensible, and, as I have
already indicated, our sense impressions are often delusive. The gamut of our
senses is very limited, and also very imperfect both as to extent and quality.
Science is continually bringing new instruments into our service, some to aid
the senses, others to correct them. The microscope, the microphone, the
refracting lens are instances. It used to be said with great certainty that you
cannot see through a brick wall, but by means of X-rays and a fluorescent screen
it is now possible to do so. I have seen my own heart beating as its image was
thrown on the screen by the Rontgen rays. Many insects, birds and animals have
keener perceptions in some respects than man. Animalculae and microbic life,
themselves microscopic, have their own order of sense-organs related to a world
of life beyond our ken. These observations serve to emphasise the great
limitation of our senses, and also to enforce the fact that Nature does not
cease to exist where we cease to perceive her. The recognition of this fact has
been so thoroughly appreciated by thoughtful people as to have opened up the
question as to what these human limitations may mean and to what degree they may
extend.</p>

<p>We know what they mean well enough: the history of human
development is the sequel to natural evolution, and this development could never
have had place apart from the hunger of the mind and the consequent breaking
down of sense limitations by human invention. As to the extent of our
limitations it has been suggested that just as there are states of matter so
fine as to be beyond the range of vision, so there may be others so coarse as to
be below the sense of touch. We cannot, however, assert anything with certainty,
seeing that proof must always require that a thing must be brought within our
range of perception before we can admit it as fact. The future has many more
wonderful revelations in store for us, no doubt. But there is really nothing
more wonderful than human faculty which discovers these things in Nature, things
that have always been in existence but until now have been outside our range of
perception. The ultra-solid world may exist.</p>

<p>The relations of our sense-organs to the various degrees of
matter, to solids, fluids, gases, atmosphere and ether, vary in different
individuals to such a wide extent as to create the greatest diversity of normal
faculty. The average wool-sorter will outvie an artist in his perception of
colour shades. An odour that is distinctly recognizable by one person will not
be perceptible to others. In the matter of sound also the same differences of
perception will be noted. On a very still night one can hear the sugar canes
growing. Most people find the cry of a bat to be beyond their range. The eye
cannot discern intervals of less than one-fiftieth of a second. Atmospheric
vibration does not become sound until a considerable frequency is attained.
Every movement we make displaces air but our sense of touch does not inform us
of it, but if we stand in a sunbeam the dust particles will show that it is so.
Our sense of feeling will not register above certain degrees of heat or below
certain degrees of cold. Sensation, moreover, is not indefinitely sustained, as
anyone may learn who will follow the ticking of a watch for five minutes
continuously.</p>

<p>But quite apart from the sense and range of our perceptions, the
equality of a sense-impression is found to vary with different persons,
affecting them each in a different way. We find that people have "tastes" in
regard to form, colour, flavour, scent, sound, fabric and texture. The
experience is too general to need illustration, but we may gather thence that,
in relation to the nervous system of man, every material body and state of
matter has a variable effect. These remarks will clear the ground for a
statement of my views upon the probable effect a crystal may have upon a
sensitive person.</p>

CHAPTER II.
<br>
<br>
MATERIALS AND CONDITIONS
<br>

<p>The crystal is a clear pellucid piece of quartz or beryl,
sometimes oval in shape but more generally spherical. It is accredited by
Reichenbach and other researchers with highly magnetic qualities, capable of
producing in a suitable subject a state analogous to the ordinary "waking
trance" of the hypnotists. It is believed that all bodies convey, or are the
vehicles of certain universal property called od or odyle (od-hyle), which is
not regarded as a force but as an inert and passive substance underlying the
more active forces familiar to us in kinetic, calorific and electrical
phenomena. In this respect it holds a position analogous to the argon of the
atmosphere, and is capable of taking up the vibrations of those bodies to which
it is related and which it invests. It would perhaps not be amiss to regard it
as static ether. Of itself it has no active properties, but in its still,
well-like depths, it holds the potentiality of all magnetic forces.</p>

<p>This odyle is particularly potent in certain bodies and one of
these is the beryl or quartz. It produces and retains more readily in the beryl
than in most other bodies the images communicated to it by the subconscious
activity of the seer. It is in the nature of a sensitized film which is capable
of recording thought forms and mental images as the photographic film records
objective things. The occultist will probably recognize in it many of the
properties of the "astral light," which is often spoken of in this connection.
Readers of my <i>Manual of Occultism </i>will already be informed concerning the
nature of subconscious activity. The mind or soul of man has two aspects: the
attentive or waking consciousness, directed to the things of the external world;
and the subconscious, which is concerned with the things of the interior world.
Each of these spheres of the mind has its voluntary and automatic phases, a fact
which is usually lost sight of, inasmuch as the automatism of the mind is
frequently confounded with the subconscious. All purposive action tends to
become automatic, whether it be physical or mental, sensory or psychic.</p>

<p>The soul in this connection is to be regarded as the repository
of all that complex of emotions, thoughts, aspirations, impressions,
perceptions, feelings, etc., which constitute the inner life of man. The soul is
none the less a fact because there are those who bandy words about its origin
and nature.</p>

<p>Reichenbach has shown by a series of experiments upon sensitive
and hypnotized subjects, that metals and other materials produce very marked
effects in contact with the human body. The experiments further showed that the
same substance affected different patients in diverse manners.</p>

<p>The hypnotic experiments of the late Dr. Charcot, the well-known
French biologist, also demonstrate the rapport existing between the sensitive
subject and foreign bodies in proximity. A bottle containing a poison is taken
at random from a number of others of similar appearance and is applied to the
back of the patient's neck. The hypnotic subject at once begins to develop all
the symptoms of arsenical, strychnine or prussic acid poisoning; it being
afterwards found that the bottle contains the toxine whose effects have been
portrayed by the subject. But not all hypnotic subjects are capable of the same
degree of sensibility.</p>

<p>Community of sensation is as common a phenomenon as community of
thought between a hypnotizer and his subject, and what are called sympathetic
pains are included in common experience. Sensitive persons will simulate all the
symptoms of a virulent disease, <i>e.g.</i> mock measles. The phenomena of
psychometry reveal the fact of bodies being able to retain records and of the
human possibility of reviving these records as sensations and thought images,
although there is no direct community of sensation between an inanimate object
and the nervous organism of a sensitive. It need not, therefore, be a matter of
surprise that the crystal can exert a very definite and sensible effect upon the
nervous organism of a certain order of subjects. It does not affect all alike
nor act in a uniform and constant manner on those whom it does so affect. The
modifications of sensibility taking place in the subject or sensitive render the
action of the agent a variable quantity. Where its action is more or less rapid
and remarkable, however, the quartz or beryl crystal may be regarded as the most
effective agent for producing clairvoyance.</p>

<p>In other cases the concave mirror, either of polished copper or
black japan, will be found serviceable. In certain cases where the faculty is
already developed but lying in latency, any shining surface will suffice to
bring it into activity. Ecstatic vision was first induced in Jacob Boehme by the
sun's rays falling upon a bowl of water which caught and dazzled his eyes while
he was engaged in the humble task of cobbling a pair of shoes. In consequence of
this exaltation of the visual sense we have those remarkable works, <i>The
Aurora, The Four Complexions, Signatura Rerum,</i> and many others, with
letters and commentaries which, in addition to being of a spiritual nature, are
also to be regarded as scholarly when referred to their source. In Boehme's
case, as in that of Swedenborg, whose faculty did not appear until he was
fifty-four years of age, it would appear that the faculty was constitutional and
already developed, waiting only the conditions which should bring it into active
operation.</p>

<p>The agent most suitable for developing clairvoyance cannot
therefore be definitely prescribed. It must remain a matter of experiment with
the subject himself. That there are some persons in whom the psychic faculties
are more prone to activity than in others is certain, and it would appear also
that these faculties are native in some by spiritual or hereditary succession,
which fact is evident from their genitures as interpreted by astrology. Many
planets in flexed signs and a satellitium in the nadir or lower angle of the
horoscope is a certain indication of extreme nervous sensibility and
predisposition to telaesthenic impressions, though this observation does not
cover all the instances before me. It is true, however, where it applies. The
dominant influence of the planet Neptune in a horoscope is also to be regarded
as a special indication of some form of psychic activity, as I have frequently
observed.</p>

<p>In cases where the subject is not prepared by evolutional
process for the exercise of the psychic faculties, it will be found that the
same or similar indications will tend to the simulation of such faculties, as by
mediumism, conjuring, etc., while they may even result in chicanery and fraud.</p>

<p>But among those who are gifted in the direction spoken of, all
are not clairvoyant. The most common form of psychic disturbance is involuntary
clairaudience, and telaesthesia is not perhaps less general. St. Paul
indicates a variety of such psychic "gifts," <i>e.g. </i>the gifts of prophecy,
of healing, of understanding, etc.; but these may also be regarded in quite a
mundane sense. The development among the early Christians of spiritual gifts,
visions, hearing, speaking in foreign tongues, psychic healing, etc., appears to
have given rise to a variety of exceptional experiences by which they were
induced to say "we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard." "One
star differs from another in glory," says St. Paul, and this diversity of
spiritual gifts proceeds from the celestial world, and is so ordered that each
may fulfil the part required of him in the economy of life.</p>

<p>Psychic tradition is as important a fact as is physical
heredity. The latter is a factor of immense importance as affecting the
constitution and quality of the organism in and through which the soul is
required to function. But psychic tradition is that which determines the power
and faculty brought to bear upon the physical organism. Past evolution is not a
negligible quantity, and its effects are never wasted or lost to the individual.
We are what we are by reason of what we have already been, as well individually
as racially. "The future is, the past unfolded" or "entered upon by a new door,"
as it has been well said. We do not suddenly acquire faculties, we evolve them
by effort and successive selection. In our upward striving for liberty we
specialize along certain lines which appear to us to be those offering either
the least resistance or the most ready means of self-preservation, liberty and
well-being. Hence some evolve a special faculty for money-making and, as
schoolboys, will be expert traders of alley-taws, jack-knives, toffee and all
sorts of kickshaws. Others of another bent or list will traffic in knowledge to
the abounding satisfaction of their masters and the jealous pride of their form.</p>

<p>So that psychic tradition while disposing some to the speedy
revelation of an already acquired faculty, disposes others to the more arduous
but not less interesting work of acquiring such faculty. And because the
spiritual needs of mankind are ever of primary importance, there are always to
be found those in whom the power of spiritual interpretation is the dominant
faculty, such persons being the natural channels of intercourse between the
superior and inferior worlds. The physical body of man is equipped with a
corresponding order of microbic life which acts as an organic interpreter,
translating the elements of food into blood, nerve, fibre, tissue and bone
agreeably to the laws of their being. What I have to say in this place is
addressed especially to those who would aspire to the faculty of clear vision
and in whom the psychic powers are striving towards expression. Every person
whose life is not wholly sunk in material and selfish pleasures but in whom the
aspiration to a higher and better life is a hunger the world cannot satisfy, has
within himself the power to see and know that which he seeks behind the veil of
the senses. Nature has never produced a desire she cannot satisfy. There is no
hope, however vague, that the soul cannot define, and no aspiration, however
high, that the wings of the spirit cannot reach. Therefore be patient and
strive. To others I would say: Be content. All birds cannot be eagles. The
nightingale has a song and the humming bird a plumage the eagle can never
possess. The nightingale may sing to the stars, the humming bird to the flowers,
but the eagle, whose tireless eyes gaze into the heart of day, is uncompanioned
in its lofty loneliness amid the mountain tops.</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.
<br>
<br>
THE FACULTY OF SEERSHIP
<br>

<p>Until quite recently the faculty of seership has been associated
in occult literature with various magical formulae. There are in existence works
by Tristemius, Francis Barrett, Ebenezer Sibley and others in which the use of
the crystal is made by means of magical invocations and a variety of ceremonial
observances. It is not within the scope of this treatise to determine the value
of such rites or the desirability of invoking extraneous intelligences and
powers by the use of magical practices; but I think we may conclude that
communion of this order is not unattended by grave dangers. When the Israelites
were ill-content with the farinaceous manna they invoked Heaven to send them
meat. They got what they wanted, but also the dire penalty which it incurred;
and it is quite likely that in invoking occult forces beyond one's power to
control great evils may ensue. All action and reaction are equal and opposite. A
child can pull a trigger but cannot withstand the recoil of a gun, or by moving
a lever may set machinery in motion which it can by no means control. Therefore
without strength and knowledge of the right sort it is foolish to meddle with
occult forces; and in the education of the development of the psychic and
spiritual faculties native in us, it is better to encourage their natural
development by legitimate exercise than to invoke the action of a stimulus which
cannot afterwards be controlled. Water will wear away a rock by continual
fretting, though nobody doubts that water is softer than a rock, and if the
barrier between this and the soul-world be like granite, yet the patient and
persistent action of the determined mind will sooner or later wear it away, the
last thin layer will break and the light of another world will stream through,
dazzling our unaccustomed eyes with its bright effulgence.</p>

<p>It is my object here to indicate by what means and by what
persons the natural development of the clairvoyant faculty may be achieved. In
regard then to the subject, medium or seer, there are two distinct temperaments
in which the faculty is likely to be dominant and capable of high and rapid
development. The first is the nervous temperament, characterized by extreme
activity of body and mind, nervous excitability, dark complexion, prominent
features, and wiry frame. Types of this temperament are to be seen in the
descriptions of Dante, Swedenborg, Melancthon, Edgar A. Poe and others. This
type represents the positive seers.</p>

<p>The other temperament is of the passive type and is
characterized by a full lymphatic habit, pale or delicate complexion, blue eyes,
straight fine hair, small hands, tapering fingers, cold and fleshy to the touch;
usually a thin or high voice and languid manner.</p>

<p>These two types of seers--of which there are many
varieties--achieve their development by quite opposite means. The positive seer
projects the mental images by a psychic process impossible of description, but
by a certain psychic metabolism by which the apperceptions of the soul are
transformed into mental images of a purely symbolical nature. The psychic
process of picture-production is involuntary and unconscious, but the perception
of the mental pictures is a perfectly conscious process and involves the
exercise of an introspective faculty. The passive seer, on the contrary, is
effortless, and receives impressions by reflection, the visions coming
imperceptibly and having a literal interpretation. The vision is not in this
case of an allegorical or symbolic nature, as is the case with the positive
seer, but is an actual vision of a fact or event which has already happened or
as it will transpire in the future. Thus the positive vision consists in the
projection of the mind towards the things of the soul-world, while the passive
vision in the result of a propulsion of the soul-world upon the passive sense.
Of the two kinds of vision, the passive is the more serviceable as being the
more perspicuous and literal, but it has the disadvantage of being largely under
the control of external influences and consequently of greater variability than
the positive vision. It is, indeed, quite the common experience that the passive
medium requires "conditions" for the proper exercise of the faculty and where
these are lacking no vision can be obtained.</p>

<p>The positive type of seer exercises an introspective vision,
searching inwardly towards the soul-world whence revelation proceeds. The
passive seer, on the other hand, remains in a static condition, open to
impressions coming inwards upon the mind's eye, but making no conscious effort
towards inward searching. Those who have experienced both involuntary and
voluntary visions will readily appreciate the difference of attitude, which is
difficult to convey to others in so many words.</p>

<p>Now the exercise of this faculty does not exist apart from some
definite use, and it may be of advantage to consider what that use may be.
Primarily, I should be disposed to regard the mere opening up of a channel of
communication between the material and psychic worlds as adequate reason for the
exercise of the faculty. The Gates of Heaven have to be kept open by human
endeavour and the exercise of the spiritual and psychic faculties, otherwise a
complete lesion and cutting off of our source of inspiration would follow.
Except we aspire to the higher world that world will come no nearer to us.
Action and reaction are equal and opposite. It was never said that the door
would be opened to others than those who knocked. The law of spiritual
compensation involves the fact that we receive what we ask for. If we get it
otherwise, there is no guarantee of its continuance or that its possession will
be a blessing. But if we ask according to our needs and strive according to our
strength there is no law which can prevent a commensurate response. The
ignorance of our asking and the imperfection of our striving will modify the
nature of the response, but they cannot be negative of results. We can trust
nature and there is a spiritual law in the natural world as well as a natural
law in the spiritual world, for they are interdependent.</p>

<p>But even our daily life affords numerous instances wherein the
use of the clairvoyant faculty is attended by beneficial results. How many
people there are who have been warned in dreams--wherein all people are
naturally clairvoyant--of some impending danger to themselves or those around
them, must have struck any casual reader of the daily press; for during recent
years much greater interest has been taken in psychological matters and we are
continually in hearing of new facts which give us knowledge of the power of the
soul to foresee danger, and to know what is determined upon the world for the
greater ends of human evolution. Some experiences of this nature will no doubt
form a fit subject for a subsequent chapter. The qualifications which should
supplement and sustain the natural aptitude of the seer or seeress demand
consideration in this place, and the following remarks may not be without value
in this respect.</p>

<p>Mental stability, self-possession and confidence in one's own
soul-faculties must be the firm rock on which all revelation should rest. The
element of doubt either negatives results or opens the door to the ingress of
all manner of deceptive impressions.</p>

<p>Integrity of purpose is imperative. The purer the intention and
motive of the seer the more lucid will be the vision accorded. No reliable
vision can be obtained by one whose nature is not inherently truthful.</p>

<p>Any selfish desire dominating the mind, in regard to any thing
or person will distort the vision and render it misleading, while a persistent
self-seeking spirit will effectually shut the door to all revelation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Therefore above all things it is essential for the investigator
of psychic phenomena to have an unflinching love of truth, to be resigned to the
will of Heaven, to accept the revelations accorded in a spirit of grateful
confidence, and to dispel all doubt and controversy by an appeal to the eyes of
one's own immortal soul.</p>

<p>These are qualifications with which the seer or seeress should
be invested, and if with these the quest of the vision is unsuccessful after a
period of earnest trial, it must be taken as sufficient warrant that the faculty
of clairvoyance is not in the category of one's individual powers. Haply the
same qualifications brought to bear on some other psychic faculty will result in
a rich recompense.</p>

<p>As for those triflers who at odd moments sit for the production
of what they call "phenomena," with no other object than the gratification of an
inquisitive vanity, I would drive them with whips from the field of psychical
research. They are people whose presence in this area of serious enquiry does no
good either to the cause of truth or the service of the race, and this loose
traffic of sorts in the hope of finding a new sensation would, were it
transferred to another sphere of activity, deservedly receive a very ugly name.</p>

<p>The suggestion that the clairvoyant faculty is latent in all of
us has no doubt been responsible for much misunderstanding, and not a little
disappointment; but I doubt if it is so far removed from the truth as that which
makes the possession of the faculty a certain sign of a superior degree of
evolution. Although the faculty of clear vision brings us into more intimate
conscious relations with a new order of existence, where the past and future,
the distant and the near, would seem to be brought into immediate perception, it
does not therefore confer upon us a higher degree of spirituality. It may
undoubtedly offer us a truer perspective than that we may derive from the
ordinary circumstance of our lives, and may suggest good grounds for a more
comprehensive ethical system, but it cannot compel one to do the right thing or
to lead the virtuous life. Clairvoyance, indeed, is a faculty which has no
direct moral relations. It is no more the gift or property of the wise or the
good man than extraordinary muscular power is an adjunct of high intelligence.
And yet it is a curious fact that in all the sacred writings of the world there
is a suggestion that holy men, or "Men of God," have this and other transcendent
faculties, such as clairaudience and the power of healing. Throughout the
Hebrew Scriptures clairaudience seems to constitute the peculiar authority of
the teacher or prophet. Thus we have expressions such as: "The Word of the Lord
came to me saying," etc., and "I heard a voice which said," etc., which is
sometimes but not always associated with direct vision. But because holy men of
old were distinguished by this power of direct vision it is not to be supposed
that all who have it are equally sanctified. By natural gift or by such means we
are here discussing, the faculty may be brought into active function, but we
should not lose sight of the fact that the attainment of righteousness implies
that "all these things shall be added unto you."</p>

<p>I think it right, therefore, to regard the quest of clairvoyance
as a legitimate occupation, providing that it is purposeful and carried out with
a right spirit, while not being allowed to interfere with the proper performance
of one's ordinary duties in life. For it is possible to become over-zealous and
even morbid over these mysteries of human life, and to become so obsessed by the
idea of their importance as practically to render oneself unfitted for any
ordinary pursuits, thereby producing an isolation that is in the best sense
unprofitable. Moreover, there are mental dangers as well as spiritual and social
to be feared, and it is unfortunately not uncommon to observe that
neuraesthenia, nervous corrosion, and even insanity attends upon the tireless
efforts of the enthusiast in this direction.</p>

<p>If we regard clairvoyance as a normal faculty we are more likely
to treat it normally than if we give it a paramount and exceptional value and
seek to beatify those in whom it appears. I am convinced from experience that it
is both normal and educable though not usually active in the large majority of
people. I am also of the opinion that it is not peculiar, except in its higher
functions, to human beings. I have known animals to possess this faculty; in a
higher degree I have seen humans in the exercise of it. Perhaps even the
archangels are yet seeking their vision of God.</p>

<p>But to us as normal beings clairvoyance should appear a
potentially normal faculty, to be studied and pursued by methods that are
efficient while yet harmless; and this is the purport of the present treatise. I
will therefore ask the reader to follow me in these pages with a mind divested
of all disposition to the supernatural.</p>

CHAPTER IV.
<br>
<br>
PRELIMINARIES AND PRACTICE
<br>

<p>The first consideration by those who would develop clairvoyance
by artificial aids is the choice of a suitable agent. It has been the practice
for many years to substitute the original beryl or "rock crystal" by a glass
ball. I admit that many specimens I have seen are very creditable productions,
but they are nevertheless quite worthless from the point of view of those who
consider material agents to be important factors in the production of
clairvoyance. The glass ball may, however, very well serve the preliminary
essential of concentration, and, if the faculty of clairvoyance is at all
active, will be entirely effective as an agent.</p>

<p>Those who have any experience at all in this matter will allow
that the rock crystal exerts an influence of an entirely different nature to
that observable in the use of glass. Indeed, so far as experiment serves us, it
may be said that glass only produces negative results and never at any time
induced clairvoyance. If this state followed upon the use of a glass ball I am
sure that the patient must have been naturally clairvoyant, in which case a bowl
of water, a spot upon a wall, a piece of polished brass or copper, or a spot of
ink would have been equally efficacious in inducing the degree of hypnosis
required. That glass spheres are equally efficient as those of crystal is true
only in two cases, namely, when clairvoyance is natural, in which case neither
need be used; and when no results are observable after due experiment, from
which we may conclude either that the agent is unsuitable or that the faculty is
entirely submerged in that individual.</p>

<p>In hypnotic clairvoyance the glass ball will be found as useful
a "field" as the best rock crystal. Yet it does not follow that because the
crystal is highly odylic and glass altogether negative the former will induce
clairvoyance. My own first experience with the crystal was entirely
disappointing, while very striking results followed immediately upon the use of
a black concave mirror.</p>

<p>The mirror is usually circular in shape and about
one-quarter-inch curve to a six-inch diameter. This gives a long focus, so that
the mirror may be hung upon a wall at about two yards distance from the subject.
A greater degree of concavity proportionate to the diameter will produce a focus
which allows the mirror to be held in the hand while resting in the lap.</p>

<p>This disposes to a very easy and passive attitude and helps
towards results. The base of the mirror may be of tin, wood or other material,
and it is usually filled with a composition of a bituminous nature, the glass
covering being painted with a preparation of coal-tar on its nether or convex
side. The exact focus and consequent size of the mirror employed as most
suitable to the individual is a matter of experiment. It is also to be observed
that the distance of the mirror, as also the angle of vision, are matters of
experiment. Beyond a certain distance it will be found that the mirror has no
"draw" on the subject. If brought closer its pull is immediately felt.</p>

<p>It is perhaps too early to theorize upon the <i>modus operandi
</i>of the "magic mirror," as it has been called. It appears to induce hypnosis
and consequent elevation of nervous activity by refracting and throwing back the
rays of magnetic energy which emanate from the subject.</p>

<center><img src="images/seph01.png" width="321" height="353" alt="[Illustration: seph01]"></center>

<p>In the foregoing illustration let A-B be the mirror with F for
its focus. Let the subject be stationed at S. Then the rays directed towards the
surface of the mirror will be represented by RR-RR. These rays impinge upon a
diamagnetic surface which is concave. The rays are therefore bent inwards and
thrown back upon the person at S in the form of a cone of energy which has the
effect of producing auto-hypnosis. There are other forms of agency, such as the
zinc disc with the copper centre as used by Braid to induce the hypnotic sleep,
but these appear to depend upon tiring the optic nerves and thus, through their
action upon the thalami to produce temporary inhibition of the whole basilar
tract of the brain.</p>

<p>The mesmerist who throws streams of energy upon the patient
would appear to be working on the same principle as that by which the person
using the concave mirror induces self-hypnosis. Possibly the latter method may
be found to be conducive to the phenomena arising from auto-suggestion, while
the conditions induced by the action of the hypnotist may be less liable to the
effects of auto-suggestion and more responsive to hypnotic suggestion, <i>i.e.
</i>the mental action of the hypnotist.</p>

<p>These, however, are considerations which need not trouble us
overmuch, since by whatever agent the subject is made clairvoyant, the results
are equally curious and informing. Auto-suggestion, at least, can hardly be
regarded in the category of objections, since we cannot auto-suggest that which
does not first of all arise as an image in the mind. It is in the spontaneous
and automatic production of auto-suggested impressions that the phenomena of
clairvoyance very largely consist; only we have to remember that the suggesting
self is a more considerable quantity than the personality to which these
suggestions are made, and is in touch with a world immeasurably greater and in
every sense less limited than that to which the person is externally related.
Looked at from whatever point of view we may choose, the phenomena of
clairvoyance cannot be adequately explained without recourse to psychology on
the one hand and occultism on the other. Psychology is needed in order to
explain the nature and faculty of the human soul, and occultism to define for us
the nature of that universal mirror in which the whole category of human events,
both past and future, are reflected. Having decided upon a course of experiments
with a crystal or mirror, the best of the kind should be obtained. A black
velvet covering should be made in which to envelop the crystal when not in use.
Mirrors are usually made with a suitable lid or covering. Care should be taken
not to scratch the surface, and all cleaning should be done with a dry silk
handkerchief kept for the purpose. Exposure to the sun's rays not only scores
the surface of a crystal or mirror, but also puts the odylic substance into
activity, distributing and dissipating the magnetic power stored up therein.</p>

<p>And now a word or two about the disposition and attitude of the
subject. The visions do not occur in the crystal itself. They may appear to do
so, but this is due, when it occurs, to the projection and visualization of the
mental images. The visions are in the mind or soul of the seer and nowhere else.
It is a matter of constitutional psychism as to where the sense of clear vision
will be located. Personally I find the sense to be located in the frontal
coronal region of the brain about 150 to the right of the normal axis of vision,
which may be regarded as the meridian of sight. Other instances are before me in
which the sense is variously located in the back of the head, the nape of the
neck, the pit of the stomach, the summit of the head, above and between the
eyes, and in one case near the right shoulder but beyond the periphery of the
body. The explanation appears to be that the nervo-vital emanations from the
body of the seer act upon the static odyle in the agent, which in turn reacts
upon the brain centres by means of the optic nerves. And this appears to be
sufficient reason why the crystal or mirror should be kept as free as possible
from disturbing elements. Water is extremely odylic and should never come in
contact with the agent employed as it effectually carries off all latent or
stored imports. I am forced to use a crude terminology in order to convey the
idea in my mind, but I recognize that the whole explanation may appear vague and
inadequate. It is of course at all times easier to observe effects than to offer
a clear explanation of them. Yet some sort of working hypothesis is constructed
when we collate our observations, and it is this that I have sought to
communicate.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, when in use the crystal or mirror should be
shaded and so placed that no direct rays from sun or artificial light may fall
upon it. The odyle, as Reichenbach so conclusively proved by his experiments,
rapidly responds to surrounding magnetic conditions and to the vibrations of
surrounding bodies, and to none more rapidly than the etheric vibrations caused
by combustion or light of any kind. There should be no direct rays of light
between the agent and the seer.</p>

<p>The room in which the sitting takes place should be moderately
warm, shady, and lit by a diffused light, such as may be obtained by a light
holland blind or casement cloth, in the daytime. The subject should sit with his
back to the source of light, and the illumination will be adequate if ordinary
print can be read by it.</p>

<p>It is important that all persons sitting in the same room with
the seer should be at least at arm's length from him.</p>

<p>Silence should be uniformly observed by those present, until the
vision is attained.</p>

<p>It will then be found convenient to have two persons present to
act as Interrogator and Recorder respectively.</p>

<p>The Interrogator should be the only person whose voice is heard,
and it should be reduced to a soft but distinct monotone. The Recorder will be
occupied in setting down in writing all questions asked by the Interrogator and
the exact answers made by the seer. These should be dated and signed by those
present when completed. It is perhaps hardly necessary to remark that
precautions should be taken to prevent sudden intrusions, and as far as possible
to secure general quiet without.</p>

<p>I may here interject an observation which appears to me
suggestive and may prove valuable. It has been observed that the inhabitants of
basaltic localities are more generally natural clairvoyants than others. Basalt
is an igneous rock composed largely of augite and felspar, which are silicate
crystals of calcium, potassium, alumina, etc., of which the Moonstone is a
variety. The connecting link is that clairvoyance is found to be unusually
active during and by means of moonlight. What psycho-physical effect either
basalt or moonlight has upon the nervous system of impressible subjects appears
to be somewhat obscure, but there is little difference between calcium light and
moonlight, except that the latter is moderated by the greater atmosphere through
which it comes to us. It is only when we come to know the psychological values
of various chemical bodies that we can hope for a solution of many strange
phenomena connected with the clairvoyant faculty. I recollect that the seeress
of Prevorst experienced positive pain from the near presence of water during her
abnormal phases. Reichenbach found certain psycho-pathological conditions to be
excited by various metals and foreign bodies when brought into contact with the
sensitive. These observations are extremely useful if only in producing an
awareness of possible reasons for such disturbance as may occur in the
conditions already cited.</p>

<p>At the outset the sittings should not last longer than at most
half-an-hour, but it is important that they should be regular, both as to time
and place. We are already informed from a number of observations that every
action tends to repeat itself under similar conditions. Habits of life and mind
are thus formed so that in time they become quite involuntary and automatic. A
cumulative effect is obtained by attention to this matter of periodicity, while
the use of the same place for the same purpose tends to dispose the mind to the
performance of particular functions. In striving for psychic development of any
sort we shall do well not to disregard these facts. For since all actions tend
to repeat themselves and to become automatic, to pass from the domain of the
purposive into the habitual, the psychic faculties will similarly, if actuated
at any set time and place, tend to bestir themselves to the same effects as
those to which they were first moved by the conscious will and intention of the
seer. Until the clairvoyant faculty is fully assured and satisfactory results
obtained without any inconvenience to the seer, not more than two persons should
be present at the sittings. These should be in close sympathy with the seer and
with each other.</p>

<p>When the sitting is over it will be found useful to repair to
another place and fully discuss the results obtained, the impressions and
feelings of the seer during the seance, and matters which appear to have a
bearing on the facts observed.</p>

<p>A person should not be disheartened if at the first few sittings
nothing of any moment takes place, but should persevere with patience and
self-control. Indeed, if we consider the fact that for hundreds of generations
the psychic faculties latent in man have lain in absolute neglect, that perhaps
the faculty of clear vision has not been brought into activity by any of our
ancestors since remote ages, it should not be thought remarkable that so few
find the faculty in them to be practically dormant. It should rather be a matter
of surprise that the faculty is still with us, that it is not wholly
irresponsive to the behests of the soul. While in the course of physical
evolution many important functions have undergone remarkable changes, and
organs, once active and useful, have become stunted, impotent, and in some cases
extinct, yet on the other hand we see that seeds which have lain dormant in arid
soil for hundreds of years can spring into leaf and flower under the influence
of a suitable climate.</p>

<p>The vermiform appendix, so necessary to the bone eaters of a
carnivorous age, has no part in the physical economy of a later and more
highly-evolved generation. The pineal gland and the pituitary body are adjuncts
of the brain whose functions have long been in latency. The <i>Anastatica
hierochuntica, </i>commonly called the Rose of Jericho, is a wonderful example
of functional latency. The plant will remain for ages rolled up like a ball of
sun-dried heather, but if placed in water it will immediately open out and
spread forth its nest of mossy green fronds, the transition from seeming death
to life taking place in a few minutes. The hygrometric properties of the plant
are certainly exceptional. They illustrate the responsiveness of certain natures
to a particular order of stimulus, and in a sense they illustrate the functions
of the human soul. The faculty of direct vision is like the latent life of the
vegetable world. It waits only the conditions which favour its activity and
development, and though for generations it may have lain dormant, yet in a few
days or weeks it may attain the proportions of a beautiful flower, a thing of
wonder and delight, gracing the Garden of the Soul.</p>

<br>
<a name="6"></a>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.
<br>
<br>
KINDS OF VISION
<br>

<p>There are two kinds of vision, and each of these may be
perceived in two different ways. The two sorts of vision are called the Direct
Vision and the Symbolic Vision.</p>

<p>The first of these is an exact representation of some scene or
incident which has taken place in the past or will subsequently be experienced
in the future. It may have relation to the experience of the seer, or of those
who are present at the sitting, or yet may have a general or public application.</p>

<p>The second order of vision is a representation by ideograph,
symbol or other indirect means, of events similar to those conveyed by direct
vision. The visions of Ezekiel and John of Patmos are of the symbolic order, and
although to the seers themselves there probably was a very clear apperception of
their import, yet for others they require interpretation. In most cases it will
be found that the nature of the vision has relation to that sphere of life and
interest in which the seer or those for whom he is serving are concerned. But
this is not always the case, for there are some peculiarly sensitive seers whose
visions have a wider range and a more general application. In the first case it
would seem that the impressions latent in the individual sphere of subconscious
activity are brought into evidence, and in the other case the seer comes into
relations with the world-soul or earth-sphere, so that political, social and
cosmic events are brought out of latency into conscious perception. In most
cases it will be found that answers to questions are conveyed by symbols, though
this is not an invariable rule, as will appear from the following remarks.</p>

<p>The vision, when it occurs, may be conveyed in one of two ways:
first, as a vivid picture affecting the focus and retina of the eye, perfect in
its outline and colouring, and giving the sense of nearness or distance;
secondly, as a vivid mental impression accompanied by a hazy or dim formation in
the "field" of vision. In this latter form it becomes an apperception rather
than a perception, the mind receiving the impression of the vision to be
conveyed before it has had time to form and define itself in the field.</p>

<p>As already intimated, there appears to be a connection between
the temperamental peculiarities of the two classes of clairvoyants and the kind
of vision developed in them. Thus the direct vision is more generally found in
association with the passive temperament. The direct vision is neither so
regular nor so constant as the symbolic vision owing to the peculiarities of the
negative or passive subject. When it does develop, however, the direct vision is
both lucid and actual, and has literal fulfilment in the world of experience and
fact. It is an actual representation of what has actually happened or will have
place in the future, or yet may be presently happening at some place more or
less distant.</p>

<p>The symbolic vision, on the other hand, is more generally
developed in the positive or active type of seer. It has the advantage of being
more regular and constant in its occurrence than the direct vision, while at the
same time being open to the objection that it is frequently misinterpreted.
Nothing shows this better perhaps than the various interpretations which have
been made of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>The positive temperament appears to throw off the mental images
as speedily as they are developed in the subconscious area, and goes out to meet
them in a mood of speculative enquiry. But the passive temperament most
frequently feels first and sees afterwards, the visionary process being entirely
devoid of speculation and mental activity. In a word, the distinction between
them is that the one sees and thinks while the other feels and sees.</p>

<p>The manner in which the visions appear to develop in the field
requires some description, and for reasons which will presently appear it is
essential that the earliest experiments should be made in the light of a duly
informed expectancy.</p>

<p>At first the crystal or mirror will appear to be overclouded by
a dull, smoky vapour which presently condenses into milky clouds among which are
seen innumerable little gold specks of light, dancing in all directions, like
gold-dust in a sunlit air. The focus of the eye at this stage is inconstant, the
pupil rapidly expanding and contracting, while the crystal or mirror alternately
disappears in a haze and reappears again. Then suddenly the haze disappears and
the crystal looms up into full view, accompanied by a complete lapse of the seer
into full consciousness of his surroundings.</p>

<p>This may be the only experience during the first few sittings.
It may be that of many. But if it occurs it is an entirely satisfactory and
hopeful symptom. For sooner or later, according to the degree of susceptibility
or responsiveness in the subject, there will come a moment when the
milky-looking clouds and dancing starlights will suddenly vanish and a bright
azure expanse like an open summer sky will fill the field of vision. The brain
will now be felt to palpitate spasmodically, as if opening and closing again in
the coronal region; there will be a tightening of the scalp about the base of
brain, as if the floor of the cerebrum were contracting; the seer will catch his
breath with a spasmodic sigh and the first vision will stand out clear and
life-like against the azure screen of space.</p>

<p>Now the danger at this supreme moment is that the seer will be
surprised into full waking consciousness. During the process of abstraction
which precedes every vision or series of visions, the consciousness of the seer
is gradually but imperceptibly withdrawn from physical surroundings. He forgets
that he is seated in a particular place or room, that he is in the company of
another or others. He forgets that he is gazing into a crystal or mirror. He
knows nothing, sees nothing, hears nothing, save that which is being enacted
before the senses of his soul. He loses sight for the time even of his own
identity and becomes as it were merged in the vision itself.</p>

<p>When, therefore, his attention is suddenly arrested by an
apparition, startling in its reality and instantaneous production, the reaction
is likely to be both rapid and violent, so that the seer is frequently carried
back into full waking consciousness. When, however, the mind is previously
instructed and warned of this stage of the process, a steady and self-possessed
attitude is ensured and a subconscious feeling of expectancy manifests at the
critical moment. I have known so many cases of people being surprised out of
clairvoyance and so to have lost what has often been an isolated experience,
that this treatise will be wholly justified if by the inclusion of this warning
the novice comes successfully through his first experience of second sight.</p>

<p>We come now to the point where it becomes necessary to consider
other important reactions which the development of any psychic sense involves.
To some favoured few these supernormal faculties appear to be given without any
cost to themselves. Perhaps they are direct evolutional products, possibly
psychic inheritances; but to such as have them no price is asked or penalty
imposed.</p>

<p>Others there are who are impelled by their own evolutional
process to seek the development in themselves of these psychic powers; and to
these a word of warning seems necessary, so that at the risk of appearing
didactic I must essay the task. To some it may seem unwelcome, to others
redundant and supererogatory. But we are dealing with a new stage in evolutional
progress--the waking up of new forces in ourselves and the prospective use of a
new set of faculties. It is of course open to anybody to experiment blindly, and
none will seek to deter them save those who have some knowledge of the attendant
dangers, and which knowledge alone can help us to avoid. I should consider the
man more fool than hero who, in entire ignorance of mechanics and aeronautics,
stepped on board an aeroplane and started the engines running. Even the most
skilful in any new field of experiment or research consciously faces certain but
unknown dangers. The victims of the aeroplane--brave pioneers of human
enterprise and endeavour that they were--fell by lack of knowledge. By lack of
knowledge also have the humane efforts of many physicians been cut short at the
outset of what might have been a successful career. It was this very lack of
knowledge they knew to be the greatest of all dangers, and it was this they had
set out to remedy.</p>

<p>It is not less dangerous when we begin to pursue a course of
psychic development. The ordinary functions of the mind are well within our
knowledge and control. There is always the will by which we may police the
territory under our jurisdiction and government. It is another matter when we
seek to govern a territory whose peculiar features and native laws and customs
are entirely unknown to us. It is obvious that here the will-power, if directed
at all, is as likely to be effectual for evil as for good. The psychic faculties
may indeed be opened up and the unknown region explored, but at fatal cost, it
may be, to all that constitutes normal sanity and physical well-being; in which
case one may say with Hamlet it be better to "bear those ills we have, than fly
to others that we know not of."</p>

<p>Some of the conditions imposed upon those who, not being
naturally gifted in this direction, would wish to experiment in clairvoyant
development, may conveniently be stated and examined in another chapter.</p>

CHAPTER VI.
<br>
<br>
OBSTACLES TO CLAIRVOYANCE
<br>

<p>Various impediments stand in the way of inducing second sight,
and certain others may be expected to arise in connection with the faculty when
induced. Putting aside the greatest of all obstacles, that of constitutional
unfitness, as having already been discussed in the preceding pages, the first
obstacle to be encountered is that of ill health. It can hardly be expected that
new areas can be opened up in the mind without considerable change and
adjustment taking place by reflection in the physical economy. The reaction is
likely to be attended by physical distress. But Nature is adaptable and soon
accommodates herself to changed conditions, so that any results directly
attributable to the development of the psychic centres of activity is not likely
to be more than transient, providing that due regard has been given to the
normal requirements of health.</p>

<p>The importance of a moderate and nourishing diet cannot be too
strongly urged upon those who seek for psychic development. All overloading of
the stomach with indigestible food and addiction to alcoholic drinks tend to
cloud the higher faculties. The brain centres are thereby depleted, the heart
suffers strain, and the equilibrium of the whole system is disturbed. Ill health
follows, the mind is centred upon the suffering body, spiritual aspiration
ceases, and the neglected soul folds its wings and falls into the sleep of
oblivion.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, one must not suppose that the adoption
of a fruit and cereal diet will of itself induce to the development of the
psychic powers. It will aid by removing the chief impediments of congestion and
disease. Many good people who adopt this dietetic reform have a tendency to
scratch one another's shoulder blades and expect to find their wings already
sprouting. If it were as easy as this the complacent cow would be high up in the
scale of spiritual aspirants.</p>

<p>The consciousness of man works from a centre which co-ordinates
and includes the phenomena of thought, feeling, and volition. This centre is
capable of rapid displacement, alternating between the most external of physical
functions and the most internal of spiritual operations. It cannot be active in
all parts of our complex constitutions at one and the same moment. When one part
of our nature is active another is dormant, as is seen in the waking and
sleeping stages, the dream-life being in the middle ground between the psychic
and physical. It will therefore be obvious that a condition in which the
consciousness is held in bondage by the infirmities of the body is not one
likely to be conducive to psychic development. For this reason alone many
aspirants have been turned back from initiation. The constitution need not be
robust, but it should at all events be free from disorder and pain. Some of the
most ethereal and spiritual natures are found in association with a delicate
organism. So long as the balance is maintained the soul is free to develop its
latent powers. A certain delicacy of organization, together with a tendency to
hyperaesthesia, is most frequently noted in the passive or direct seer; but a
more robust and forceful constitution may well be allied to the positive type of
seership.</p>

<p>As a chronic state of physical congestion is altogether adverse
to the development of the second sight or any other psychic faculty, so the
temporary congestion following naturally upon a meal indicates that it is not
advisable to sit for psychic exercise immediately after eating. Neither should a
seance be begun when food is due, for the automatism of the body will naturally
demand satisfaction at times when food is usually taken and the preliminary
processes of digestion will be active. The best time is between meals and
especially between tea and supper, or an hour after the last meal of the day,
supposing it to be of a light nature. The body should be at rest, and duly
fortified, and the mind should be contented and tranquil.</p>

<p>The attitude of the would-be seer should not be too expectant or
over-anxious about results. All will come in good time, and the more speedily if
the conditions are carefully observed. It is useless to force the young plant in
its growth. Take time, as Nature does. It is a great work and much patience may
be needed. Nature is never in a hurry, and therefore she brings everything to
perfection. The acorn becomes the sturdy oak only because Nature is content with
small results, because she has the virtue of endurance. She is patient and
careful in her beginnings, she nurses the young life with infinite care, and her
works are wonderfully great and complete in their issues. Moreover, they endure.
Whoever breathes slowest lives the longest.</p>

<p>This statement opens up a very important matter connected with
all psychic phenomena, and one that deserves more than casual notice. It has
been long known to the people of the East that there is an intimate connection
between brain and lung action, and modern experiment has shown by means of the
spirometer that the systole and diastole motion of the hemispheres of the brain
coincide exactly with the respiration of the lungs. The brain as the organ of
the mind registers every emotion with unerring precision. But so also do the
lungs, as a few common observations will prove. Thus if a person is in deep
thought the breathing will be found to be long and regular, but if the mind is
agitated the breathing will be short and stertorous, while if fear affects the
mind the breathing is momentarily suspended. A person never breathes from the
base of the lung unless his mind is engrossed. Hard exercise demands deep
breathing and is therefore helpful in producing good mental reactions. It is
said that the great preacher De Witt Talmage used to shovel gravel from one side
of his cellar to the other as a preliminary to his fine elocutional efforts. It
is this obvious connection between respiration and mental processes which is at
the base of the system of psycho-physical culture known as <i>Hatha Yoga </i>in
distinction from <i>Râj Yoga, </i>which is concerned solely with mental and
spiritual development. The two systems, which have of late years found frequent
exposition in the New Thought school, are to be found in Patanjali's <i>Yoga
sutrâ. </i>Some reference to the synchronous action of lung and brain will also
be found in Dr. Tafel's translation and exposition of Swedenborg's luminous work
on <i>The Brain. </i>In this work the Swedish seer frankly refers his
illumination regarding the functions of the brain to his faculty of
introspective vision or second sight, and it is of interest to observe that all
the more important discoveries in this department of physiology during the last
two centuries are clearly anticipated by him. The scientific works of this great
thinker are far too little known by the majority, who are apt to regard him only
as a visionary and a religious teacher.</p>

<p><i>Ad rem</i>. The vision is produced. The faculty of clairvoyance
is an established fact of experience and has become more or less under the
control of the mind. There will yet remain one or two difficulties connected
with the visions. One is that of time measure, and another that of
interpretation. The former is common to both orders of vision, the direct and
the symbolic. The difficulty of interpretation is, of course, peculiar to the
latter order of vision.</p>

<p>The sensing of time is perhaps the greatest difficulty
encountered by the seer, and this factor is often the one that vitiates an
otherwise perfect revelation. I have known cartomantes and diviners of all sorts
to express their doubt as to the possibility of a correct measure of time. Yet
it is a question that follows naturally upon a clear prediction--When?</p>

<p>It is sometimes impossible to determine whether a vision relates
to the past, the present, or the future. In most cases, however, the seer has an
intuitive sense of the time-relations of a vision which is borne in upon him
with the vision itself. It will generally be observed that in ordinary mental
operations the time sense is subject to localization, and a distinct throw of
the mind will be experienced when speaking of the past and the future.
Personally I find the past to be located on my left and the future on my right
hand, but others inform me that the habit of mind, places the past behind and
the future in front of them, while others again have the past beneath their feet
and the future over their heads. It is obviously a habit of mind, and this
usually inheres in the visionary state so that a sense of time is found to
attach to all visions, though it cannot be relied upon to register on every
occasion. But also it is frequently found that there is an automatic allocation
of the visions, those that are near of fulfilment being in the foreground of the
field, the approximate in the middle ground, and the distant in the background;
position answering to time interval. In such case the vision has a certain
definition or focus according to the degree of its proximity. These points are,
however, best decided by empiricism, and rarely does it happen that the
intuitive sense of the seer is at fault when allowed to have play.</p>

<p>The other difficulty to which I have referred, that of
interpretation of symbols when forming the substance of the vision, may be dealt
with somewhat more fully. Symbolism is a universal language and revelation most
frequently is conveyed by means of it. As a preliminary to the study of
symbolism the student should read Swedenborg's <i>Hieroglyphical Key to Natural
and Spiritual Mysteries, </i>one of the earliest of his works and in a great
measure the foundation of his thought and teaching. The Golden Book of Hermes
containing the twenty-two Tarots is open to a universal interpretation as may be
seen from the works of the Kabalists, and in regard to their individual
application may be regarded in a fourfold light, having reference to the
spiritual, rational, psychic and physical planes of existence. It is by means of
symbols that the spiritual intelligences signal themselves to our minds, and the
most exalted vision is, as an expression of intelligence, only intelligible by
reason of its symbolism. Something more may be said in regard to the
interpretation of symbols which may possibly be of use to those who have made no
special study of the subject, and this may conveniently form the material of
another chapter.</p>

CHAPTER VII.
<br>
<br>
SYMBOLISM
<br>

<p>Symbols formed the primitive language of the human race, they
spoke and wrote in symbols. The hieroglyphic writings of the aborigines of
Central America, of the ancient Peruvians, of the Mongolians, and of the ancient
Copts and Hebrews all point to the universal use of the ideograph for the
purpose of recording and conveying ideas.</p>

<p>If we study the alphabets of the various peoples, we shall find
in them clear indications of the physical and social conditions under which they
evolved. Thus the Hebrew alphabet carries with it unmistakable evidence of the
nomadic and simple life of those "dwellers in tents." The forms of the letters
are derived from the shapes of the constellations, of which twelve are zodiacal,
six northern and six southern. This implies a superficial intimacy with the
heavens such as would result from a life spent in hot countries with little or
no superstructure to shut out the view. The wise among them would sit beneath
the stars in the cool night air and figure out the language of the heavens.</p>

<p>It was God's message to mankind, and they sought not only to
understand it but to make imitation of it. So they built an alphabet of forms
after the pattern of things in the heavens. But when we come to the names of
these forms or letters we come at once into touch with the life of the people.
Thus <i>aleph</i>, an ox; <i>beth</i>, a tent; <i>daleth</i>, a tent-door; <i>
lamed</i>, an ox-goad; <i>mem</i>, water; <i>tzadde</i>, a fish-hook; <i>quoph</i>,
a coil of rope; <i>gimel</i>, a camel; <i>yod</i>, a hand; <i>oin</i>, an
eye; <i>vau</i>, a hook or link; <i>heth</i>, a basket; <i>caph</i>, a head; <i>
nun</i>, a fish; <i>phe</i>, a mouth; <i>shin</i>, a tooth; <i>resh</i>, a head;<i>
</i>etc., all speaking to us of the ordinary things of a simple, wandering life.
These symbols were compounded to form ideographs, as <i>aleph </i>= a, and <i>
lamed </i>= l, being the first and last of the zodiacal circle, were employed for
the name of the Creator, the reverse of these, <i>la</i>, signifying
non-existence, negation, privation. In course of time a language and a
literature would be evolved, but from the simple elements of a nomadic life.
Knowledge came to them by action and the use of the physical sense. They had no
other or more appropriate confession of this than is seen in the root
<font FACE="Times New Roman (Hebrew)">&#1491;&#1506;</font>
yedo--knowledge, compounded of the three symbols <i>yod</i>, <i>daleth</i>, <i>
oin</i>--a hand, a door, an eye. The hand is a symbol of action, power,
ability; the door, of entering, initiation; the eye, of seeing, vision,
evidence, illumination.</p>

<p>Hence the ideograph formed by the collation of these symbols
signifies, opening the door to see, <i>i.e. </i>enquiry.</p>

<p>The Chinese alphabet of forms is entirely hieroglyphic and
symbolical in its origin, though it has long assumed a typal regularity. What
were once curved and crude figures have become squared and uniform letterpress.
But the names of these forms bring us into touch at once with the early life of
the Mongolian race. We have, however, indications of a wider scope than was
enjoyed by the primitive Semites, for whereas we find practically all the
symbols of the Hebrews employed as alphabetical forms, we also have others which
indicate artifice, such as <i>hsi, </i>box; <i>chieh, </i>a seal or stamp; <i>
mien, </i>a roof; <i>chin, </i>a napkin; <i>kung, </i>a bow; <i>mi, </i>silk; <i>
lei, </i>a plough, and many others, such as the names of metals, wine, vehicles,
leather in distinction from hides, etc. But further, we have a mythology as part
of the furniture of the primitive mind, the dragon and the spirit or demon being
employed as radical symbols.</p>

<p>Considered in regard to their origin, symbols may be defined as
thought-forms which embody, by the association of ideas, definite meanings in
the mind that generates them. They wholly depend for their significance upon the
laws of thought and the correspondence that exists between the spiritual and
material worlds, between the subject and object of our consciousness, the
noumenon and phenomenon.</p>

<p>All symbols therefore may be translated by reference to the
known nature, quality, properties and uses of the objects they represent. A few
interpretations of symbols actually seen in the mirror may serve to illustrate
the method of interpretation.</p>

<p>A foot signifies a journey, and also understanding. A mouth
denotes speech, revelation, a message. An ear signifies news, information; if
ugly and distorted, scandal and abuse.</p>

<p>The sun, if shining brightly, denotes prosperity, honours, good
health, favours.</p>

<p>The moon when crescent denotes success, public recognition,
increase and improvement; when gibbous, sickness, decadence, loss and trouble.</p>

<p>The sun being rayless or seen through a haze denotes sickness to
a man, some misfortune, danger of discredit. When eclipsed it denotes the ruin
or death of a man. The moon similarly affected denotes equal danger to a woman.
These are all natural interpretations and probably would be immediately
appreciated.</p>

<p>But every symbol has a threefold or fourfold interpretation and
the nature of the enquiry or purpose for which the vision is sought will
indicate the particular meaning conveyed. For if the enquiry be concerning
things of the spiritual world the interpretation of the answering vision must be
in terms of that world, and similarly if the question has relation to the
intellectual or the physical worlds. Thus a pain of scales would denote in the
spiritual sense, absolute justice; in the intellectual, judgment, proportion,
comparison, reason; in the social, debt or obligation, levy, rate, or tax; and
in the material, balance of forces, equilibrium, action and reaction. If the
scales are evenly balanced the augury will be good and favourable to the purport
of the quest, but if weighted unevenly it is a case of <i>mene, tekel, upharsin;
</i>for it shows an erring judgment, an unbalanced mind, failure in one's
obligations, injustice. A sword seen in connection with the scales denotes
speedy judgment and retribution. This is an illustration of an artificial
symbol.</p>

<p>A ship is a symbol of trading, of voyaging, and is frequently
used in the symbolical vision. If in full sail it indicates that communication
with the spiritual world is about to be facilitated, that news from distant
lands will come to hand, that trade will increase, that a voyage will be taken.
If writing should appear on the sails it will be an additional means of
enlightenment. If flying the pirate flag it denotes translation to another land,
death. The land indicated may be the spiritual world itself, in which case the
death will be natural; but if it should be a foreign country, then death will
take place there by some unlooked-for disaster. The ship's sails being slack
denotes a falling off of afflatus or spiritual influx, loss of trade,
misfortune, delays and bad news, or if news is expected it will not come to
hand.</p>

<p>Black bread denotes a famine; spotted or mottled bread, a
plague. This symbol was seen in June 1896, with other symbols which connected it
with India, and there followed a great outbreak of bubonic plague in that
country. This symbol, however, was not properly understood until the event came
to throw light upon it. The following note is from a seance which took place in
India in the spring of 1893: "A leaf of shamrock is seen. It denotes the United
Kingdom or the Triple Alliance. It is seen to split down the centre with a black
line. It symbolizes the breaking of a treaty. Also that Ireland, whose symbol is
the shamrock, will be separated by an autonomous government from the existing
United Kingdom and will be divided into two factions."</p>

<p>In this way all symbols seen in the crystal or mirror may be
interpreted by reference to their known properties and uses, as well as by the
associations existing between them and other things, persons and places, in the
mind of the seer. Nor is it always required that the scryer should understand
symbology, for as already said, the meanings of most of the symbols will be
conveyed to the consciousness of the seer at the time of their appearance in the
field. Experience will continually throw new light upon the screen of thought,
and a symbol once known will assume a constant signification with each seer, so
that in course of time a language will be instituted by means of which constant
revelations will be made.</p>

<p>It will thus be obvious, I think, that symbolism is to a large
extent subject to a personal colouring, so that the same symbol may, by
different associations, convey a different meaning to various seers. This may
arise in part from the diversities of individual experience, of temperament, and
the order to which the soul belongs in the spiritual world. These
dissimilarities between individuals may be noted from their highest intellectual
convictions down to the lowest of their sensations, and it is difficult to
account for it. We all have the same laws of thought and the same general
constitution. Humanity comprehends us all within the bonds of a single nature.
Yet despite these facts we are divided by differences of opinion, of emotion, of
sympathy, of taste and faculty. It is probable that these differences obtain in
spheres immeasurably higher than our own, the sole element of consent being the
recognition of dependence upon a Higher Power. God is the co-ordinating centre
in a universe of infinite diversity.</p>

<p>Therefore, despite the fact that symbolism is capable of a
universal interpretation, it would appear that the images projected by the
magical power of the soul must have different significations with each of us,
the meanings being in some mysterious way in agreement with the nature of the
person who sees them. Hence we may come to the conclusion that every person must
be his own interpreter, there being no universal code for what are peculiarly
individualized messages. For although every symbol has a general signification
in agreement with its natural properties and uses, it yet obtains a particular
signification with the individual.</p>

<p>It is within common experience with those who have regard to the
import of dreams, wherein the faculty of seership is acting on its normal plane,
that a dream constantly recurring is found to have a particular meaning, which
however is not applicable to others who have a similar dream. Every person is a
seer in dream life, but few pay that attention to dreams which their origin and
nature warrant. The crystal or mirror is an artificial means of bringing this
normal faculty of dreaming into activity in waking life. Those who are capable
of making the dream life normal to the working consciousness, rise to a higher
plane when they sleep.</p>

<p>But, as stated above, the differences of import or meaning, even
in dream life, of any particular symbol is a common experience. One person will
dream of wading in water whenever there is trouble ahead. Another will dream of
a naked child, and yet another of coal, when similar trouble is in store.
Butchers' meat will signify financial trouble to one person, to another the same
will denote a fortunate speculation.</p>

<p>The controlling factor in this matter would appear to be founded
in the mental and psychic constitution conferred by physical heredity and
psychic tradition, converging at the conception of the individual and expressed
in the birth. Probably an argument could thence be made in regard to the
influence of the planets and the general cosmic disposition attending upon
birth: I have frequently found that dreams may be interpreted by reference to
the individual horoscope of birth, and if dreams, possibly also visions, which
are but dreams brought into the field of conscious reality. But any such
argument, however tempting, would be beyond the scope of this work.</p>

CHAPTER VIII.
<br>
<br>
ALLIED PSYCHIC PHASES
<br>


<p>The faculty of second sight is not by any means the most common
of the psychic powers. Psychometric impressions which proceed by the sense of
touch into that of a superior order of feeling are far more general. We are
affected much more than is generally recognized by the impressions gathered from
the things we have contact with, and it is quite a common experience that very
delicate and sensitive people take the "atmosphere" of places into which they
go. I have in mind an instance of an extremely high-keyed person who invariably
takes on the atmosphere of new localities, houses and even rooms. Going to view
a house with the object of taking it on rental, she will as likely as not
pronounce against the moment she enters on the ground that it is a "house of
death" or a "quarrelsome house," full of sickness, intemperance or what not, and
wherever enquiry has been possible it has invariably confirmed her impressions.
On one occasion she had telegraphed to engage a room at an hotel in a seaside
town, and on being shown to it by the maid found that it was locked. While the
maid went to fetch the key the young lady tried the door and immediately
received a psychometric impression. "Oh, M--," she said to her companion, "we
cannot possibly have this room, there's a corpse in it!" This was confirmed,
almost as soon as said, by the appearance of the proprietor, who explained that
the maid had made a mistake in the number of the room, and then, feeling that
there was a state of tension, confidentially informed his visitors that the
locked room had really been booked to them but the old lady who was to have
vacated it that morning had unfortunately died, and in order not to distress the
other visitors the door had been locked pending the removal of the body, and
even the servants had not been informed of it.</p>

<p>The experiments of Denton recorded in his <i>Soul of Things </i>
are full of interest for those who would learn something more about the
phenomena of psychometry.</p>

<p>The suggestion is that every particle of matter has its own aura
or "atmosphere" in which are stored up the experiences of that particle. What is
said of the particle applies also to the mass of any body, and in effect we get
the aura of a room, of a house, of a town, of a city; and so successively until
we come to that of the planet itself. These stored-up impressions are not caused
by the mental action of human beings in association with the material
psychometrized, they appertain entirely to the associations of the material
itself, and the psychometric sense consists in recovering these associations and
bringing them into terms of human sense and consciousness. The experience seems
to suggest a nexus between the individualized human soul and the world-soul in
which the generic life is included; also that the human soul is a specialized
evolution from the world-soul, and hence inclusive of all stages of experience
beneath the human. I think it was Draper who suggested in his <i>Conflict </i>
that a man's shadow falling upon a wall produced an indelible impression which
was capable of being revived. The cinematograph film is that brick wall raised
to the nth power of impressibility. The occultist will point you to a universal
medium as much above the cinema film as that is above the brick or stone, and in
which are stored up the <i>memoria mundi. </i>It is this sensitized envelope of
the planetary atom that your sensitive taps by means of his clairvoyant,
psychometric and clairaudient senses.</p>

<p>Clairaudience is far more general than second sight, but there
is the same variability in the range of perception as is seen in clairvoyance
and psychometry. Thus while one hears only the evil suggestions of "obsessing
spirits" or discarnate souls being dinned into his ears, another will be lifted
to the third heaven and hear "things unutterable." Brain-cell discharges will
hardly account for the phenomena of clairaudience. A brain-cell discharge never
goes beyond the repetition of one's own name in some familiar voice, or at most
the revival of a phrase or the monotonous clang of a neighbouring church bell.
These are not clairaudiences at all. Clairaudience consists in receiving
auditory impressions of intelligible phrases not previously associated with the
name of person or place involved in the statement. These impressions may be
sporadic or may be continuous. In the case of a genuine development where the
interior sense is fully opened up, the communication will be continuous and
normal, as much so as ordinary conversation, and the translation of
consciousness into terms of sense will be so rapid and unimpeded as to give the
impression to an Englishman that he is listening to his native language and to a
Frenchman that he is listening to French, though the communication may proceed
from a source which renders this impossible. The universal language of humanity
is neither Volapuk, nor Esperanto, nor Ido. It is Thought, and when thought
proceeds from a point beyond the plane of differentiation it can be determined
along the line which makes for English as readily as that which makes for
French, or any other tongue. It is they of the soul-world who convey the
thought, it is we of the sublunary world who translate that thought into our own
language. The Hebrew prophets were almost uniformly instructed by means of
clairaudience. But as I have already said there are degrees of clairaudience, as
of any other psychic faculty. The danger is that a false value may be set upon
the experiences, especially during the early stages of development when
everything is very new and very wonderful.</p>

<p>Telepathy is another and yet more general phrase of psychic
activity. It may consist in the transmission from one person to another of a
feeling or impression merely, which results in a certain degree of awareness to
the state of mind in which the transmitter may be at the time, as when a mother
has a "feeling" that all is not well with her absent child. Or it may yet take a
more definite and perspicuous form, even to the transmission of details such as
the names of persons and places, of numbers, forms and incidents. Telepathy
commonly exists between persons in close sympathy; and when two persons are
working along separate lines toward the same result, it is quite usual that they
unconsciously "telepath" with one another, their brains being for the time in
synchronous vibration. Spiritual communication in any degree is nothing more or
less than sympathy--those who feel together, think together. The modern
development of the aerial post is a step towards the universal federation of
thought, but it is not comparable with the astral post which carries a thousand
miles an hour. In this sort of correspondence the communication is written like
any ordinary letter designed for transmission, but instead of stamping and
posting it, a lighted match is applied to the finished work. The material part
is destroyed, but the intangible and only real and lasting part remains behind.
This is attached, by the direction of the will, to a particular person and set
in a certain direction. If all the conditions have been properly observed it
will not fail to reach its destination. I have fortunately been able to
demonstrate this fact in public on more than one occasion. The phenomenon is
repeated in a less striking form in every case of what is called "crossing," as
when one correspondent feels suddenly called upon to write urgently to another
and receives a reply to his enquiries while his letter is still in course of
delivery.</p>

<p>Nature is full of a subtle magic of this sort for which we have
no organized science. It is said that if you put snails together and afterwards
separate them, placing each upon a copper ground to which electric wires are
attached, a shock given to one snail will be registered by the other at the same
moment. I have not tried this theory, but the idea is fundamental to a mass of
telepathic observations which have found practical expression in wireless
telegraphy. Some thirty years ago, however, I made trial of the twin magnet
theory and was entirely successful in getting wireless messages from one room to
another. The performance was, however, clumsy and tedious, and I did not then
know enough to see how it could be perfected. The idea is now in the very safe
custody of the Patents Office.</p>

<p>Community of taste can be demonstrated under hypnosis. It is not
otherwise usually active in sensitives, and Swedenborg was hence of opinion that
the sense of taste could not be obsessed. This, however, is incorrect. I have
illustrated community of all the senses under hypnosis in circumstances which
entirely precluded the possibility of feint or imposition on the part of the
subject.</p>

<p>Another phase of psychic activity is that illustrated in
"dowsing" or water-finding by means of the hazel fork. It may be accounted a
form of hyperaesthesia and no doubt has a nervous expression, but it is not the
less psychic in its origin. I have already referred to the action of water upon
psychic sensitives, and there seems little room for doubt that it is the
psychometric sense which, by means of the self-extensive faculty inhering in
consciousness, registers the presence of the great diamagnetic agent. Professor
Barrett has written a most interesting monograph on this subject, and there are
many books extant which make reference to and give examples of this curious
phenomenon. The late British Consul at Trieste and famous explorer and linguist,
Sir Richard Burton, could detect the presence of a cat at a considerable
distance, and I have heard that Lord Roberts experiences the same paralyzing
influence by the proximity of the harmless feline. If, therefore, one can
register the presence of a cat, and another that of a dead body, I see no
difficulty in others registering water or any other antipathetic. All we have to
remember is that these things are psychic in their origin, and not ignorantly
confound sensation with consciousness, or hyperaesthesia with the various
psychopathic faculties we have been discussing. But it is necessary to return to
our main subject and consider where our developed clairvoyant or second-sight
faculty will lead us, and what sort of experience we may expect to gain by its
use. These points may now be dealt with.</p>

<br>
<a name="10"></a>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.
<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE AND USE
<br>

<p>First let us have the facts, we can then best see what use we
can make of them. This I think is the correct position in regard to any abnormal
claim that is made upon our attention. Everybody has heard of the prophecies of
the Brahmin seer, most people have some acquaintance with the phenomena
attending the clairvoyance of the seeress of Prevorst, while the experiences of
Emanuel Swedenborg have been set forth in many biographies, but in none more
lucidly and dispassionately than that by William White. Traditions have come to
us concerning the clairvoyance of the Greek exponent of the Pythagorean
teachings, Apollonius of Tyana, and the case of Cavotte, who predicted his own
death and that of Robespierre and others by the guillotine, is on record. The
illumination of Andrew Jackson Davis, the Poughkeepsie seer, and that of Thomas
Lake Harris of Fountain Grove, are modern examples of abnormal faculty of a
nature which places them outside the field of direct evidence. A prophecy made from the use of the super-sense which
is followed by exact fulfilment appears to be the best criterion, though it is a
very imperfect illustration of the scope of clairvoyance.</p>

<p>The following instances are within my personal experience, and
being already on record and well attested, will serve equally to illustrate the
fact of clairvoyance as would numerous others within my knowledge.</p>

<p>In June, 1896, a lady visited me in Manchester Square and, being
anxious on several points, asked that I would scry for her. A blue beryl was
used as agent. She was told that she would have news from a tropical country
concerning the birth of a child, a boy, who would arrive in the following year
in the month of February. That on a certain date while travelling she would meet
with an accident to the right leg. Previous to this, in October she would have a
welcome surprise connected with papers and a contest in which her son was
engaged.</p>

<p>Now here was a network of disaster for any would-be prophet who
relied upon what is called the "lucky shot." If we enumerate the items of
prediction, on any of which a fatal error could have been made, we shall find a
very formidable list:--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tropical country.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A birth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A boy then unborn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; February, 1897.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A journey on a particular date.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right leg.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The son.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Papers.</p>

<p>At least nine points on which the faculty could have been wholly
at fault. The fulfilment, however, came in due course. The lady heard that her
sister, then vicereine of India, was about to have a child, and in February,
1897, a son was born to Lord Elgin. In October the lady referred to was
agreeably surprised to learn that her son had passed his examination for the
military college with honours. Further, while boarding a train at Victoria
station she had the misfortune to slip between the platform and the footboard,
so that the shin of the right leg was badly damaged and severe muscular strain
was also suffered, in consequence of which she was laid up for several days.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. was consulted by an authoress, her profession being
unknown to the scryer. She was told that she would go up a dingy staircase with
a roll of papers under her arm; that she would see a dark man, thickset and of
quiet demeanour. He would take the roll of papers and it would be a source of
good fortune to her. The prediction was literally fulfilled.</p>

<p>The first case cited is an example of the positive and symbolic
type of vision; the second being of the passive and direct type.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. was consulted by a lady of the writer's acquaintance and
was told that she would not marry the man to whom she was then engaged as there
was a certain other person, described, coming across the seas to claim her. She
would meet him three years later in the month of January.</p>

<p>The event transpired exactly as stated, though nothing at that
time appeared less probable, and indeed the lady was not a little irate at the
allusion to the breaking off of the engagement and of marrying a man whom she
had never seen and for whom she could have no sort of regard. In fact, the whole
revelation was very revolting to one so wholly absorbed as was she at the time.
It cannot be argued that this was a case of suggestion working itself out, for
one cannot auto-suggest the arrival of a person of a particular description from
a distant land to one's own drawing-room at any time, and there is here a
prediction as to the date which was duly fulfilled. This was a case of direct
vision.</p>

<p>Mrs. G. consulted a seer on September 27, 1894. She was told she
would have sickness affecting the loins and knees; that she would be the owner
of a house in the month of December; that a removal would be made when the trees
were leafless; that there would be a dispute about a sum of money.</p>

<p>This is positive or symbolical clairvoyance. The symbols seen
were as follow: a figure with a black cloth about the loins, the figure stooping
and resting the hands upon its knees. A house covered with snow, bare trees
around it. A bird on a leafless branch; the bird flies away. Several hands seen
grabbing at a pile of money.</p>

<p>All the predictions were fulfilled.</p>

<p>Interpretations of symbols when made during the vision are
frequently far removed from what one would be led to expect. But we have to
remember that the seer is then in a psychologized state, and there is reason to
believe that interpretations made from the inner plane of consciousness are due
to the fact that the symbols appear in a different light. Our ordinary dreams
follow the same change. While asleep we are impressed by the importance and
logical consistency of the dream incident, which assumes, possibly, the
proportions of a revelation, but which dissolves into ridiculous triviality and
nonsense as soon as we awake. The reason is that there is a complete hiatus
between the visionary and the waking state of consciousness, and even the laws
of thought appear to undergo a change as the centre of consciousness slides down
from the inner to the outer world of thought and feeling.</p>

<p>In the Eastern conception the three states of <i>jagrata, </i>
waking, <i>swapna, </i>dreaming, and <i>sushupti, </i>sleeping, are penetrated
by the thread of consciousness, the <i>sutr<font face="Times New Roman">â</font>tma, </i>a node of complete
unconsciousness separating one state from the next. The centre of consciousness,
like a bead on the thread, alternates between the three states as it is impelled
by desire or will.</p>

<center><img src="images/seph02.png" width="410" height="504" alt="[Illustration: seph02]"></center>

<p>I have known sickness predicted, both as to time and nature of
the malady; the receipt of unexpected letters and telegrams with indications of
their contents and resulting incident; changes, voyages, business transactions,
deaths, and even changes in the religious views of individuals, all by means of
the crystal vision.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the visionary state is induced by
excessive emotion during which the prophetic faculty is considerably heightened.
Some temperaments on the other hand will fall into the clairvoyant condition
when engaged in deep thought. The thread of thought seems suddenly to be broken,
and there appears a vision wholly unconnected with the subject but a moment ago
absorbing the mind. It is as if the soul, while probing the depths of its inner
consciousness, comes into contact with the thin partition which may be said to
divide the outer world of reason and doubt from the inner world of intuition and
direct perception, and breaking through, emerges into the light beyond. In
trance there is generally a development of other super-senses, such as
clairaudience and psychic touch, as well as clairvoyance. Examples might be
multiplied and would but serve to show that the rapport existing between the
human soul and the world soul, the individual consciousness and the collective
consciousness, is capable of being actively induced by recourse to appropriate
means and developed where it exists in latency by means of the crystal, the
black concave mirror or other suitable agent. As yet, however, the majority are
wholly ignorant of the existence of such psychic faculties, and even those who
possess them are conscious of having but an imperfect control of them.</p>

<p>As in the case of genius where nature is opening up new centres
of activity in the mind, the casual observer notes an eccentricity hardly
distinguishable from some incipient forms of insanity; so the development of new
psychic faculties is frequently attended by temporary loss of control over the
normal brain functions. Loss of memory, hysteria, absent-mindedness, unconscious
utterance of thought, illusions, irritability, indifference, misanthropy and
similar perversions are not infrequent products of the preliminary stages of
psychic development. These, however, will pass away as the new faculty pushes
through into full existence. Nature is jealous of her offspring and concentrates
the whole of her forces when in the act of generation, and that is the reason of
her apparent neglect of powers and functions, normally under her control, while
the evolution of a new faculty is in process. Let it be understood therefore
that the faculty of clairvoyance or any other super-sense is not to be
artificially developed without some cost to those who seek it. "The universe is
thine; take what thou wilt, but pay the price," says Emerson. This is the divine
mandate. It is not merely a question of the price of a crystal or a mirror, the
sacrifice of time, the exercise of patience: it may mean something much more
than this. It is a question of the price of a new faculty. What is it worth to
you? That is the price you will be required to pay. And with this equation in
mind the reader must consider the use to which, when obtained, he will apply his
faculty; for the virtue of everything is in its use. It is reasonable to presume
that one's daily life can supply the true answer. To what use are we employing
the faculties we already have, all of them acquired with as much pain and
suffering, it may be, as any new ones we are ever likely to evolve? If we are
using these faculties for the benefit of the race we shall employ others that
are higher to even greater effect. In other case it is not worth the effort of
acquiring, nor is it likely that anybody of a radically selfish nature will take
the trouble to acquire it. Natural selection is the fine sieve which the gods
use in their prospecting. The gross material does not go through.</p>

CONCLUSION.
<br>

<p>The foregoing short treatise will gain some practical value by a
statement of the conditions most suitable for scrying.</p>

<p>A diffused natural light, preferably from the north, is always
better than an artificial light.</p>

<p>The subject should sit with his back to the source of light, at
a distance from the mirror determined by its focus; or if the agent be a crystal
it should be held in the hands, one supporting the other.</p>

<p>Steady gazing in complete silence should be maintained for a
quarter of an hour, which may be afterwards gradually extended to half or even a
full hour. Success depends largely upon idiosyncrasy and temperamental aptitude.
Seers are often to be found among men and women of imperfect education owing to
fitness of temperament; seers of this order are born with the faculty. Others,
seemingly non-sensitive at first, may develop the faculty after a few short
sittings.</p>

<p>The eyes should not be strained, but the gaze should be allowed
to rest casually yet steadily on the agent as if one were reading a book.</p>

<p>It will be found that the sight is presently drawn inwards to a
focus beyond the surface of the agent. This opening up of the field of vision is
the symptom of success. The next step is indicated by a change in the atmosphere
of the field. Instead of reflecting or remaining translucent, the agent will
appear to cloud over. This will appear to become milky, then to be diffused with
colour which changes to black or murky brown, and finally the screen appears to
be drawn away, revealing a picture, a scene, figures in action, symbolical
forms, sentences, etc.</p>

<p>The physiological symptoms are: first, a slight chill along the
spine like cold water trickling from the neck downwards; secondly, a returning
flush of heat from the base of the spine upwards to the crown of the head;
thirdly, a gaping or spasmodic action of the brain; and lastly, a deep inward
drawing of the breath, as if sobbing. When these symptoms follow closely upon
one another, vision will be assured. It generally happens, however, that the
various symptoms are separately developed by repeated sittings, only appearing
in proper sequence when the experiment is finally successful.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting phases of this development of second
sight is the opening up of lost impressions, the revival of lapsed memories;
"looking for one thing, you find another" is an experience in daily life which
has a psychological application. The things which pass into the limbo of
forgetfulness are never lost to us. They remain stored up in latency and are
ready to spring into activity as soon as the depths of the mind are probed.
Necessarily this experience is more generally interesting than pleasant, but it
serves to give one a sense of the connectedness of life's incident and to show a
certain sequential necessity in the course of events. The "whyness" of our
various experiences is revealed when they are displayed in their true relations
and given their true value in the scheme of individual evolution. As detached
experiences they appear without reason or purpose, apparently futile, often
painful and even cruel; but as a consecutive scheme, completed by the revival of
all the connecting links, the wisdom, justice, kindness and beneficence of the
Great Arbiter of our destinies are fully and conspicuously revealed. My own
first suspicions of a former embodied existence were derived from psychic
experiences, and later on were confirmed by the course of events. I saw myself
reaping that which I had sown, and I observed that what was sown in ignorance
might be reaped in the light of a fuller knowledge; only we must henceforth be
wise in the sowing. I would say in conclusion that it is the duty of man to
himself and humanity not only to hold himself in readiness, but also to fit
himself for the reception of new light. Since evolution is the law of life and
the glory of going on man's highest guerdon, and since we are all candidates for
responsibility, asking as reward for work well done to-day a task of greater
magnitude on the morrow, it appears that the development of the psychic
faculties may well form an orderly step in the process of human perfectibility,
and help to bring us nearer to the source of all good. If it serves only to keep
open the door between the two worlds it will have filled a good purpose, and if
in the writing of this little exposition, I may have contributed to the
confidence and security of any who may adventure these obscure paths, I shall be
well content.</p>
